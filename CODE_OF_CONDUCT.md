# VaultEnv CLI Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the VaultEnv CLI community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

As a security-focused project, we also pledge to maintain the highest standards of security consciousness and responsible disclosure practices that protect our users' sensitive data.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Following security best practices and encouraging others to do the same
- Helping newcomers understand our security requirements without condescension

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Deliberately introducing security vulnerabilities or malicious code
- Publicly disclosing security vulnerabilities without following responsible disclosure practices
- Using the project to store or distribute actual production secrets or credentials
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Security-Specific Guidelines

Given the sensitive nature of environment variable management, we have additional guidelines:

### Responsible Disclosure

- **Never** post security vulnerabilities in public issues, pull requests, or discussions
- Report security issues privately to: gnana097@gmail.com
- Allow at least 90 days for us to address critical vulnerabilities before public disclosure
- Work with us in good faith to understand and resolve the issue

### Code Contributions

When contributing code, especially security-related features:

- Never include real credentials, API keys, or secrets in code, comments, or commit messages
- Use example or dummy values like `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` or `example-secret-key`
- Follow secure coding practices and be open to security review feedback
- Document security implications of your changes
- Write tests that verify security properties, not just functionality

### Discussion Guidelines

When discussing security topics:

- Share knowledge about security best practices constructively
- Avoid fear-mongering or exaggerating security risks
- Respect that security is a journey - help others improve rather than shame them
- Focus on education and improvement, not criticism

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

For security-related violations, immediate action may be taken to protect the community, including but not limited to:

- Immediate removal of malicious code or exposed secrets
- Temporary suspension pending investigation
- Permanent ban for deliberate security violations

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Given our security focus, this Code of Conduct also extends to:

- Any disclosure of VaultEnv CLI security vulnerabilities
- Any use of VaultEnv CLI in security research
- Any discussion of VaultEnv CLI's security architecture

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at gnana097@gmail.com.

Security-related issues should be reported to gnana097@gmail.com.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or security policy violations.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or deliberate security violations.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
