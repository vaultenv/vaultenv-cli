## Test Implementation Details

### 1. **Command Tests** (`internal/cmd`)
- ✅ **Set Command**: Full parsing, validation, and execution tests
- ✅ **Get Command**: Multiple output formats, special characters
- ✅ **List Command**: Pattern matching, sorting, formatting
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Complete CLI workflows
- ✅ **Concurrent Operations**: Race condition testing
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Special characters, long values, empty values

### 2. **UI Package Tests** (`internal/ui`)
- ✅ **Output Functions**: All output methods (Success, Error, Warning, etc.)
- ✅ **Color Handling**: NO_COLOR environment variable support
- ✅ **Table Rendering**: Complex table layouts
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Custom error types with helpful messages
- ✅ **Progress Indicators**: Spinner functionality
- ✅ **Output Redirection**: Configurable output writers

### 3. **Storage Tests** (`pkg/storage`)
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Set, Get, Delete, List, Exists
- ✅ **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe operations
- ✅ **Stress Testing**: 10,000+ key handling
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarks**: Sub-microsecond operations

### 4. **Encryption Tests** (`pkg/encryption`)
- ✅ **AES-GCM Implementation**: Encrypt/decrypt operations
- ✅ **Key Derivation**: Argon2id implementation
- ✅ **String Helpers**: Base64 encoding/decoding
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Invalid keys, corrupted data

### 5. **Keystore Tests** (`pkg/keystore`)
- ✅ **Mock Implementation**: Full mock keystore functionality
- ✅ **Service Isolation**: Multi-service key management
- ⚠️ **OS Integration**: Not tested (requires OS keychain)

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Fixed Output Capture**: Modified UI package to support test output redirection
2. **Test Environment Setup**: Created comprehensive test helpers
3. **Mock Implementations**: Added mock storage and keystore backends
4. **Table-Driven Tests**: Consistent, maintainable test structure
5. **Benchmark Tests**: Performance validation for critical paths

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

- **Fast Tests**: Most tests complete in milliseconds
- **Isolated Tests**: Each test runs independently
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run concurrently where possible
- **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive names for test scenarios
- **Good Coverage**: Critical paths have high coverage

## Areas for Future Improvement

1. **Init Command**: Complex interactive flow needs testing
2. **OS Keystore**: Integration tests with real OS keychains
3. **Completion Command**: Shell completion functionality
4. **File Storage**: When implemented, will need tests
5. **Error Injection**: More comprehensive error scenario testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# View coverage report in terminal
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Run tests for a specific package
go test -v ./internal/cmd

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...
```

## Conclusion

The test coverage has been significantly improved from the initial state. The critical paths are well-tested, with the UI package achieving 100% coverage and storage package at 83.9%. The overall coverage of 65% provides good confidence in the codebase while leaving room for future improvements as new features are added.
